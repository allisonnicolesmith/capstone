      <p><span>S</span>hakespeare once wrote, “There are more things in heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.” Today, the same could be said of the online sexual marketplace. The World Wide Web has diversified forms of sex
        work. Demand
        for amateur, non-studio porn has exploded, expanding online pornographic industries like camming, in which sex workers interact with clients. Online adult creators post content on subscription sites like OnlyFans. Some websites connect phone
        sex workers with new customers, while other sites facilitate sugaring relationships. You can even buy and sell used panties on the web.</p>

      <p>Still, this marketplace is a far cry from the Internet of yesteryear that Mary — whose name has been changed to protect her from being identified as a sex worker — and other sex workers like her remember before legislators and policymakers
        doubled down laws ostensibly meant to curb online sex trafficking. </p>
      <p>In 2011, Mary entered the sex trade as a dominatrix. She met clients three or four days a week at a midtown Manhattan “dungeon,” where she enacted fantasy sequences and flogged and psychologically dominates clients for $220 per session.
        (Her take home pay was $80 per session). Her hours were flexible, which gave her the freedom to juggle part-time college classes while managing PTSD and Bipolar II. She credits her long tenure in the sex industry to the fact she could make
        enough to live without working full-time hours. At the same time, she offered her dominatrix services independently online; all she had to do was post an ad on Backpage or Craigslist personals, see two or three clients per week, and she could
        make enough to scrape by. In 2016, Mary retired from sex work. But when she returned a mere three years later, she found the industry had been turned inside out by the passage of SESTA/FOSTA, which then-President Donald Trump signed into law
        in 2018 and effectively eliminated many of sex workers’ avenues for online sex work.</p>

      <p>The concept of virtual sex is nothing new, and the future it harbingers, one in which internet sex work is increasingly normalized, signals to some a kind of dystopian doom, like the sexbots in the 1982 sci-fi film Blade Runner. It’s
        precisely this moral panic that has galvanized anti-sex work feminists and social reformers in recent years, and their lobbying efforts have transformed the sexual marketplace in the process — and not for the better, many sex workers,
        activists, and academics argue. Still, the online sex work has continued to thrive, anyway, buoyed by a pandemic that shuttered everyone indoors and distracted them with the Pandora’s box of the modern era: the internet. </p>

      <p>OnlyFans, the de facto online platform for sex work, was founded in 2016 and had 348,000 creators before the pandemic. By the end of fiscal 2020, that number nearly quintupled to 1.6 million. According to the company's own projections,
        OnlyFans expected gross merchandise value to grow from $2.2 billion in 2020 to $12.5 billion next year, with net revenue also expected to spike more than five-fold to $2.5 billion by 2022. Its CEO, 37-year-old British entrepreneur Timothy
        Stokely, is estimated to be worth $100 million and his past of sketchy business exploits include websites that claimed to link to celebrity sex tapes, underage porn, and bestiality. Sex workers flocked to OnlyFans during lockdown when
        in-person work was no longer viable option. </p>

      <p>The problem is that while sex-driven platforms like OnlyFans have thrived, sex workers, by and large, have not. When Mary returned to sex work in 2019, she had no more regulars and struggled to find new ones. Posting ads for dominatrix
        services no longer generated enough income, so for the first time, at the age of 30, she waded into “full service” sex work, an industry term that refers to those who offer in-person sex services. According to her, clients refused to be
        screened and often paid less than those she saw as a dominatrix. </p>

      <p>“The days where you could post an ad online and make a living have largely passed,” she said. According to her, she was relying on lower paid managed work before the pandemic hit. Then, all the clients “disappeared.” That was when she turned
        to OnlyFans. </p>

      <p>I ask her the number one question on my mind: How easily could I make money on OnlyFans? Every day I read new headlines like “TikToker is building dream home using OnlyFans earnings” and “Mom’s dare turns into $480,000-a-year OnlyFans
        career.”</p>

      <p>Her answer: “I think I’m just starting to make $15 an hour after 14 months of being underpaid for all the work I’ve put in.”
      </p>

      <hr>

      <p>For about as long as the internet has existed, sex has been on it. Perhaps more importantly, as long as the internet has existed, sex has found a way to innovate and profit from it. </p>

      <p>In “How the Internet Happened: From Netscape to the iPhone,” Brian McCullough’s suspiciously sex-free 2018 book on the history of the Internet — the index contains one reference to sex, obliquely mentioned “sexy chat” that took place in AOL
        chatrooms in the Internet’s embryonic years, and there are zero references to porn — the author makes an erroneous claim. When the Wall Street Journal launched on the web in 1996, it restricted its content solely to paying subscribers. That
        part is true. “A paywall ended up being successful for the Journal, which eventually accumulated around a million online subscribers,” McCullough asserts, “proving that there were some types of content that audiences were willing to pay for.”
      </p>

      <p>In fact, this trail had already been blazed by an industrious former stripper named Danni Ashe. A native of South Carolina, Ashe moved to Los Angeles to model in men’s magazines and star in softcore pornographic videos after workplace
        harassment in the strip club industry left her wanting more autonomy. She read a book on HTML programming while on a beach vacation and created her own online fan site in 1995 — a year before the Journal launched into cyberspace — which she
        brilliantly dubbed Danni’s Hard Drive. But to access the site’s content, users had to pay a subscription fee of $15 per month, still a novel idea at the time. Just after the site launched, Ashe told some friends about it before hopping on a
        plane to New York City, and by the time she reached her Manhattan hotel room a few hours later, her internet service provider told her that the sheer amount of traffic to Danni's Hard Drive site had caused their servers to crash. For the next
        two years, it was the most popular site on the web. Ashe's business model wasn’t too dissimilar from what OnlyFans — and Just for Fans and LoyalFans — are doing now except Ashe owned the enterprise and got to keep the net profits for herself.
        By 2001, the website was estimated to be worth $30 million, making Ashe one of the first dotcom millionaires. </p>

      <p>Similarly, Beth Mansfield was a housewife and accountant living in a mobile home in Tacoma, Washington when she created an online emporium called Persian Kitty, named after her cat. Unlike Ashe, Mansfield didn’t post her own erotica.
        Instead, the webmistress catalogues the site with links to other adult websites. The site quickly went viral and one month after the site launched, Mansfield’s ISP kicked her off for attracting too much traffic. Her first year, she reeled in
        $3.5 million in click-throughs. </p>

      <p>The rest of the world marveled at the explosion of online porn in the embryonic years of the internet. The Wall Street Journal noted that cyberporn was “fast becoming the envy of the Internet. While many other Web outposts are flailing,
        adult sites are taking in millions of dollars a month. Find a Web site that is in the black and, chances are, its business and content are distinctly blue.” But porn moguls were doing more than just posting smutty pictures to the World Wide
        Web. Pornographers had capitalized on early innovations in internet marketing, livestreaming, digital advertising, and had figured out how to upsell visitors to pony up dollars for subscriptions. Cam sites like Babes4u were making as much as
        $60,000 per month by charging users $19.95 for 20 minutes of personal interaction. “Internet pornographers deploy savvy tactics that mainstream sites would do well to imitate,” the Journal wrote. </p>

      <p>But even as sex workers have carved out room for themselves in cyberspace, the internet has never been a stable home. In March 2018, then-President Trump signed into law the “Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act”
        (FOSTA), a law ostensibly designed to curtail sex trafficking by amending Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.</p>

      <p>Section 230 protects American internet companies from liability for the behavior of its users, but FOSTA holds websites and online platforms responsible for user content that might facilitate sexual exploitation. Crucially, it failed to
        distinguish between nonconsensual and consensual sex work, and there is still no concrete data showing whether the law achieved its aims. But the consequences were felt deeply among sex workers. According to a 2020 survey of 98 internet-based
        sex workers, 99 percent of respondents said the law didn't make them feel safe, and 72 percent said it decreased their ability to make ends meet by shutting down many safer avenues for sex work like Backpage and Craigslist personals, which
        allowed them to screen clients and share information. An increasingly stratified industry has revealed sex workers’ creative strategies as indicative of a marginalized and unprotected labor force in crisis. </p>

      <p>Although creators can achieve a windfall on OnlyFans, the work is inherently precarious. On August 19, OnlyFans announced it was banning “sexually explicit” content from its site in order to legitimize its operations in the eyes of investors
        and major banking institutions. Days later, following severe backlash, the company said it would “suspend” the policy changes. It did not, however, reverse them, leaving low-income earners in ongoing precarity. At any moment, OnlyFans or the
        banks could cut off sex workers again.</p>

      <p>We’ve all read the headlines about sex workers who make more than $100,000 per year on the platform, and how the average OnlyFans participant makes more than 270 times the average worker. But the reality is, according to a comprehensive
        study conducted by Influencer Marketing Hub, the average OnlyFans user makes $180/month, and most accounts take home less than $145/month. The top one percent of the accounts on OnlyFans make about 33 percent of all the money.</p>

      <p>Confined to media channels that haven’t censored them outright, it’s worth noting that the media that sex workers produce on sites like OnlyFans and elsewhere is meant for customers. Such media are not representations of sex workers in their
        totality. In other words, they do not represent the life of a sex worker when she isn’t working, nor are they intended to. This hasn’t stopped anti-sex work feminists and social reformers from using them as conditions of sex work. What these
        so-called glamorized depictions indirectly reveal about sex work is the is the amount of unpaid labor that’s now required among sex workers, from curating a personal brand and attracting a fan base to expenditures for lighting and camera
        equipment. It used to be a sex worker could post an ad on a website like Backpage or Craigslist and make money. But now sex workers have to be influencers, too.</p>

      <p>People who sell sex are presented in media accounts only in stereotype: Most people have read NY Post headlines that feature either the happy empowered businesswoman-slash-sex worker or the tragic, down-on-her-luck prostitute. But for every
        sex worker who can dedicate 40 or more hours per week and turn her hustle into a thriving busines, there are dozens more who are struggling to make ends meet, says Mary. </p>

      <hr>

      <p>Despite its reputation, there’s nothing very sexy about OnlyFans’ white-and-aqua interface. Unlike Persian Kitty, you won’t be greeted by images of scantily clad women striking seductive poses. You won’t receive suggestions to click on ads
        for “sexy student bodies” or “Game of Bones.” Instead, the OnlyFans algorithm will suggest you follow recording artists and chefs and fitness gurus. Even its users are not pornographers or sex workers, but rather the more antiseptically
        called “creators.” The only way to find adult content is to search for a specific user; unlike Pornhub, you cannot refine your search with filters or key words, rendering the search function on OnlyFans mostly useless unless you know who
        exactly you’re looking for. It’s practically impossible to gain subscribers through the site itself, and for creators without built-in social media followings, makes it difficult to achieve any kind of windfall. </p>

      <p>As Charlotte Shane notes in her New York Times Magazine feature about OnlyFans, “Newbies aren’t precluded from accruing a large base of followers or developing smaller groups of die-hard fans, and some manage it well. But attracting paying
        admirers for one’s self-created work doubles the amount of labor required to get paid anything at all.” </p>

      <p>Mary said she’s had some success gaining paying subscribers through search engine optimization — that is, inputting commonly searched-for terms to boost her OnlyFans profile via Google. Still, she says the additional unpaid labor hasn’t been
        worth it.</p>

      <p>“It’s a full-time job,” says Mary. “Customers want new content from you every day. You’re always posting new photos, new videos. Fans want one-on-one attention from you. It’s a daily grind."</p>

      <p>OnlyFans users pay to unlock direct messages, along with individual posts hidden behind pay walls. Fans tip to request “customs,” or personalized photos, videos, and audio recordings, from their favorite content creators. The latter is where
        Mary and other content creators say most of their money comes from. </p>

      <p>““I really hate what sex work has become, whether you’re working online, on OnlyFans, or just trying to advertise your services online,” she said.</p>

      <p>Mary has had to adapt to a very different landscape for online sex work. According to her, the time-to-money equation for sex work has shifted, too. When the pandemic first hit, Mary attended numerous seminars about how to transition to
        online work, most of which were based on the unspoken assumption that sex workers could dedicate 40 hours a week if not more. Mary, whose roommates didn’t know she was a sex worker, also pointed out space and privacy are major obstacles. She
        grabbed every opportunity she could to borrow apartments from friends, other sex workers, and her sugar daddy, hopscotching from Brooklyn to Lower Manhattan and holing up for an entire day to shoot videos and edit them to maximize her time
        and money.

      <p>Mary has had to adapt to a very different landscape for online sex work. According to her, the time-to-money equation for sex work has shifted, too. When the pandemic first hit, Mary attended numerous seminars about how to transition to
        online work, most of which were based on the unspoken assumption that sex workers could dedicate 40 hours a week if not more. Mary, whose roommates didn’t know she was a sex worker, also pointed out space and privacy are major obstacles. She
        grabbed every opportunity she could to borrow apartments from friends, other sex workers, and her sugar daddy, hopscotching from Brooklyn to Lower Manhattan and holing up for an entire day to shoot videos and edit them to maximize her time
        and money. </p>

      <p>The industry has become increasingly stratified. In order to earn a living wage, most new sex workers will now either work for management on the lower end of the hourly income spectrum, or they will need to put a lot of time and energy into
        building their own brand. </p>

      <p>Mary uses a lot of different platforms to advertise and on most of them she has to carefully curate and monitor her accounts in case they get suspended or shadow banned. Since the shutdown of Backpage and similar sites, sex workers trying
        to work online are constantly at the mercy of the algorithm and discriminatory content moderation practices, but not having access to those spaces to advertise raises the barrier to entry, making it much harder for people who are often trying
        to make money quickly.</p>


      <hr>

      <p>The death of Backpage, Craiglist’s Personals section, and similar ad websites as a result of SESTA-FOSTA legislation introduced in Congress in 2018 traces its origins to the rise and fall of alt-weekly papers across the nation, including the
        Village Voice, which was one of the most well-known alt-weeklies. Local alt-weekly publications grew to be venerated sources of local and independent journalism, often launching the careers of new and emerging writers. </p>

      <p>A series of mergers during the 1980s and 1990s characterized the alt-weekly paper industry. Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin, journalists who founded the alt-weekly Phoenix New Times in 1970 as college students and infused it with a contrarian
        sensibility, spearheaded these consolidations. This started the New Times chain of alt-weeklies, and as part of this enterprise, they took over numerous alt-weekly papers coast-to-coast. They also merged with the Village Voice. The rise of
        classified advertising website Craigslist was a blow to newspapers with classified listings, but it represented a crucial sea change for the sex work industry and how sex workers advertised their services. </p>

      <p>Like other alt-weeklies, New Times’ papers were free to read, making their revenue from ads posted in the classifies section. The idea for Backpage came from Carl Ferrer, a New Times salesman, who pitched it as a competitor to Craigslist. In
        2004, they registered the domain name Backpage.com, which WIRED magazine described as "a bare-bones inter-face wrapped in Facebooky blue, similar to Craigslist in form and function." The name was a nod to the classified ads in the back
        section of every New Times paper, "culminating in a premium-priced ad showcase on the paper's back page." </p>

      <p>The venture turned out to be highly profitable: The site went from earning $26 million in 2010 to more than $134 million in 2014. By 2015, it had reportedly earned its owners more than $500 million. </p>

      <p>On March 5, 2009, Tom Dart, the Sheriff of Cook County Illinois, filed a federal lawsuit against Craigslist, alleging the website was a “public nuisance” because it facilitated prostitution. He also sought $100,000 in reimbursement for
        investigator costs. At a press conference, Dart flipped back and forth between sex trafficking and sex work interchangeably before admitting his solution was to arrest all parties involved, including minors: “We're talking about charges we
        have for human trafficking, for juvenile rescue for juvenile pimping, for prostitution — we have all of it here. We have arrested 16-year-old girls, 15-year-old girls who have been posted on Craigslist,” he said. “And yet we have this, this
        website that facilitates this. And somehow we're all supposed to feel good about because it's a legitimate business. Since when have we felt good about a legitimate business that facilitates a criminal act is an accomplice? How's this any
        different than two individuals that enter into an agreement to conduct prostitution, where one will handle the women and the other one is going to advertise for them?”</p>

      <p>A court judge dismissed Dart’s lawsuit seven months later, citing the federal “safe harbor” law of the internet, colloquially referred to as Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, or Section 230 for short. The law stated, “No
        provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” In other words, websites could not be held liable for content users post on
        the internet.</p>

      <p>In the case of Dart’s lawsuit, the court determined that Craigslist couldn't be sued over sex work ads because Craigslist wasn't personally writing the ads. Plus, having an erotic services section didn't by default mean that Craigslist was
        encouraging illegal activity. There are plenty of completely legal services that fit under that category, like a stripper hired for a bachelor party.</p>

      <p>Dart’s lawsuit resulted in several changes to the Craigslist website. They began charging for ads, required credit cards, and they renamed “erotic services” to “adult services.” They also boosted their content moderation efforts so that
        every adult post was reviewed by a human being. But none of these changes appeased their critics. And ultimately, on September 3, 2010, Craigslist shut down its adult section without warning and with little fanfare — just the word “censored”
        where the link for “adult services” used to be. Sex workers who advertised their services on Craigslist pivoted to other sites, the main one being Backpage. </p>

      <p>Tension mounted in January 2017 when the investigations arm of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs published a report after a nearly two-year-long investigation into Backpage. It argued that the site knowingly
        enabled crimes through its automated filtering of specific terms. By now letting users publish posts with phrases like “barely legal,” the report argued, Backpage was, in fact, coaching child traffickers to better cover their tracks. Backpage
        got rid of its adult section just a few days after the report dropped although sex work ads continued to appear discreetly in the personal section. </p>

      <p>A month later, a documentary of survivors called I Am Jane Doe, zeroed in on Backpage and made the case that the safe harbor provision protecting the online classifieds site from liability for ads on its sites should be removed to curb
        online sex trafficking, and with it, online sex work. </p>

      <p>In April, Missouri representative Ann Wagner introduced the “Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act,” also known as FOSTA. A few months later, the Senate introduced their own version of FOSTA called the “Stop Enabling
        Sex Trafficking Act,” or SESTA. Both bills proposed carving out an exception in Section 230 for sex trafficking and promoting prostitution. Supporters said denying websites like Backpage these protections would make it possible to prosecute
        them. SESTA/FOSTA are generally talked about together as a single bill that was ostensibly written to prosecute Backpage. </p>


      <div class="infographic">
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/9THbRLd/FOSTA-SESTA.png">
      </div>
      <p class="caption">Infographic by Allison Nicole Smith</p>

      <p>Legal experts immediately voiced their concerns for doing away with Section 230. Eric Goldman, an associate dean for research and professor of law at Santa Clara University School of Law wrote on his blog that SESTA “would expose Internet
        entrepreneurs to additional unclear criminal risk, and that would chill socially beneficial entrepreneurship well outside the bill’s target zone.” </p>

      <p>Goldman’s warning about the chilling effects of Section 230 turned out to be true. Within hours of the bill passing the Senate in March 2018, Reddit banned several sex work-oriented subreddit communities. Within days, Craigslist removed its
        entire personal section. And after then-President Trump signed it into law, House representatives celebrated those shutdowns as the direct result of the new law.</p>

      <p>Although the bill’s supports claimed SESTA/FOSTA would better enable to police websites and thereby curb online sex trafficking, as well as allow survivors to sue those websites that facilitated their trafficking, there is no data to suggest
        SESTA/FOSTA has curbed online sex trafficking. </p>

      <p>“It [SESTA/FOSTA] conflates prohibition with abolition,” says Mary. “If we take ad sites down, then sex trafficking will go away.” But this fails to acknowledge how the internet made it easier for sex workers to solicit clients safely, such
        as having the ability to screen clients and share tips and harm-reduction information with other sex workers. The bill also fails to differentiate between consensual sex work and sex trafficking, which is nonconsensual. </p>

      <p>Neither Backpage or Craigslist personals were perfect advertising platforms, Mary says. Ideally, sex workers wouldn’t be isolated or limited to sex worker-only platforms but would be able to advertise their services as easily and as simply
        as any other entrepreneur or businessperson. </p>

      <p>The last time I see Mary, we have cause to celebrate: “I just quit OnlyFans,” she tells me before we clink classes outside a bar in the Lower East Side. With vaccination rates rising, in-person clients have returned to pre-pandemic levels.
        Still, with the Omicron variant on the rise, Mary admits she may need to reopen her OnlyFans if Covid-19 caess surge. Mary also recently
        earned her master’s degree, so she plans to dedicate more time to her “vanilla” work and leave the sex industry entirely soon. But the mood is bittersweet, she says, for friends and colleagues of hers who are still doomed to the hustle of
        OnlyFans, where most users have to make a “million little marketing decisions” for little payout. </p>

      <p>In Mary’s words, “They want so much from me for so little.”</p>
