      <p><span>I</span>f you want to read up on the adult industry, the radical bookstore, café, and activist center Bluestockings, nestled in Manhattan’s Lower East Side, is your sexy Library of Alexandria. It carries over 6,000 titles, a chunk of
        which is devoted to all things prostitution: manifestos and personal essays straight from the mouths of sex workers, academic studies and historical surveys about the industry, graphic novels, and more.</p>

      <p>Bluestockings is where 31-year-old Mary*, a sex worker and OnlyFans creator, works as its zine coordinator three to four days, 20 hours per week. It’s also where I ask her the number one question on my mind: How easily could I make money on
        OnlyFans?</p>

      <p>Every day I read new headlines like “TikToker is building dream home using OnlyFans earnings” and “Mom’s dare turns into $480,000-a-year OnlyFans career.”</p>

      <p>Silhouetted against paperback copies of "Playing the Whore" by Melissa Gira Grant and "Porn Work" by Heather Berg, Mary takes a sip of her coffee before answering: “I think I’m just starting to make $15 an hour after 14 months of
        being terrifically underpaid for all the work I’ve put in.”</p>

      <p>Shakespeare once wrote, “There are more things in heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.” Today, the same could be said of the online sexual marketplace. The World Wide Web has diversified forms of sex work. Demand
        for amateur, non-studio porn has exploded, expanding online pornographic industries like camming, in which sex workers interact with clients. Online adult creators post content on subscription sites like OnlyFans. Some websites connect phone
        sex workers with new customers, while other sites facilitate sugaring relationships. You can even buy and sell used panties on the web.</p>

      <p>Still, this marketplace is a far cry from the Internet of yesteryear that Mary and other sex workers like her remember before legislators and policymakers doubled down laws ostensibly meant to curb online sex trafficking.</p>

      <p>In 2011, Mary entered the sex trade as a dominatrix. She met clients three or four days a week at a midtown Manhattan “dungeon,” where she enacted fantasy sequences, flogged grown men, and verbally humiliated clients for $100 per session.
        Her hours were flexible, which gave her the freedom to juggle part-time college classes while managing PTSD and Bipolar II. She credits her long tenure in the sex industry to the fact she could make enough to live without working full-time
        hours. At the same time, she offered her dominatrix services independently online; all she had to do was post an ad on Backpage or Craigslist personals, see two or three clients per week, and she could make enough to scrape by. In 2016, Mary
        retired from sex work. But when she returned a mere three years later, she found the industry had been turned inside out by the passage of SESTA/FOSTA, which then-President Donald Trump signed into law in 2018 and effectively eliminated many
        of sex workers’ avenues for online sex work.</p>

      <p>The concept of virtual sex is nothing new, and the future it harbingers, one in which internet sex work is increasingly normalized, signals to some a kind of dystopian doom, like the sexbots in the 1982 sci-fi film Blade Runner. It’s
        precisely this moral panic that has galvanized anti-sex work feminists and social reformers in recent years, and their lobbying efforts have transformed the sexual marketplace in the process — and not for the better, many sex workers,
        activists, and academics argue. Still, the online sex work has continued to thrive, anyway, buoyed by a pandemic that shuttered everyone indoors and distracted them with the Pandora’s box of the modern era: the internet. </p>

      <p>OnlyFans, the de facto online platform for sex work, was founded in 2016 and had 348,000 creators before the pandemic. By the end of fiscal 2020, that number nearly quintupled to 1.6 million. According to the company's own projections,
        OnlyFans expected gross merchandise value to grow from $2.2 billion in 2020 to $12.5 billion next year, with net revenue also expected to spike more than five-fold to $2.5 billion by 2022. Its CEO, 37-year-old British entrepreneur Timothy
        Stokely, is estimated to be worth $100 million and his past of sketchy business exploits include websites that claimed to link to celebrity sex tapes, underage porn, and bestiality. Sex workers flocked to OnlyFans during lockdown when
        in-person work was no longer viable option. </p>

      <p>The problem is that while sex-driven platforms like OnlyFans have thrived, sex workers, by and large, have not. When Mary returned to sex work in 2019, she had no more regulars and struggled to find new ones. Posting ads for dominatrix
        services no longer generated enough income, so for the first time, at the age of 30, she waded into “full service” sex work, an industry term that refers to those who offer in-person sex services. According to her, clients refused to be
        screened and often paid less than those she saw as a dominatrix. </p>

      <p>“The days where you could throw up an ad online and do well have largely passed,” said Mary. “As someone who began in 2011, retired in 2016, and came back in 2019 to a very different sex industry — no client base — I was mostly moving in the
        direction of lower paid managed work until the pandemic began. Then all the clients skittered away.”</p>

      <hr>

      <p>For about as long as the internet has existed, sex has been on it. Perhaps more importantly, as long as the internet has existed, sex has found a way to innovate and profit from it. </p>

      <p>In “How the Internet Happened: From Netscape to the iPhone,” Brian McCullough’s suspiciously sex-free 2018 book on the history of the Internet — the index contains one reference to sex, obliquely mentioned “sexy chat” that took place in AOL
        chatrooms in the Internet’s embryonic years, and there are zero references to porn — the author makes an erroneous claim. When the Wall Street Journal launched on the web in 1996, it restricted its content solely to paying subscribers. That
        part is true. “A paywall ended up being successful for the Journal, which eventually accumulated around a million online subscribers,” McCullough asserts, “proving that there were some types of content that audiences were willing to pay for.”
      </p>

      <p>In fact, this trail had already been blazed by an industrious former stripper named Danni Ashe. A native of South Carolina, Ashe moved to Los Angeles to model in men’s magazines and star in softcore pornographic videos after workplace
        harassment in the strip club industry left her wanting more autonomy. She read a book on HTML programming while on a beach vacation and created her own online fan site in 1995 — a year before the Journal launched into cyberspace — which she
        brilliantly dubbed Danni’s Hard Drive. But to access the site’s content, users had to pay a subscription fee of $15 per month, still a novel idea at the time. Just after the site launched, Ashe told some friends about it before hopping on a
        plane to New York City, and by the time she reached her Manhattan hotel room a few hours later, her internet service provider told her that the sheer amount of traffic to Danni's Hard Drive site had caused their servers to crash. For the next
        two years, it was the most popular site on the web. Ashe's business model wasn’t too dissimilar from what OnlyFans — and Just for Fans and LoyalFans — are doing now except Ashe owned the enterprise and got to keep the net profits for herself.
        By 2001, the website was estimated to be worth $30 million, making Ashe one of the first dotcom millionaires. </p>

      <p>Similarly, Beth Mansfield was a housewife and accountant living in a mobile home in Tacoma, Washington when she created an online emporium called Persian Kitty, named after her cat. Unlike Ashe, Mansfield didn’t post her own erotica.
        Instead, the webmistress catalogues the site with links to other adult websites. The site quickly went viral and one month after the site launched, Mansfield’s ISP kicked her off for attracting too much traffic. Her first year, she reeled in
        $3.5 million in click-throughs. </p>

      <p>The rest of the world marveled at the explosion of online porn in the embryonic years of the internet. The Wall Street Journal noted that cyberporn was “fast becoming the envy of the Internet. While many other Web outposts are flailing,
        adult sites are taking in millions of dollars a month. Find a Web site that is in the black and, chances are, its business and content are distinctly blue.” But porn moguls were doing more than just posting smutty pictures to the World Wide
        Web. Pornographers had capitalized on early innovations in internet marketing, livestreaming, digital advertising, and had figured out how to upsell visitors to pony up dollars for subscriptions. Cam sites like Babes4u were making as much as
        $60,000 per month by charging users $19.95 for 20 minutes of personal interaction. “Internet pornographers deploy savvy tactics that mainstream sites would do well to imitate,” the Journal wrote. </p>

      <p>But even as sex workers have carved out room for themselves in cyberspace, the internet has never been a stable home. In March 2018, then-President Trump signed into law the “Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act”
        (FOSTA), a law ostensibly designed to curtail sex trafficking by amending Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.</p>

      <p>Section 230 protects American internet companies from liability for the behavior of its users, but FOSTA holds websites and online platforms responsible for user content that might facilitate sexual exploitation. Crucially, it failed to
        distinguish between nonconsensual and consensual sex work, and there is still no concrete data showing whether the law achieved its aims. But the consequences were felt deeply among sex workers. According to a 2020 survey of 98 internet-based
        sex workers, 99 percent of respondents said the law didn't make them feel safe, and 72 percent said it decreased their ability to make ends meet by shutting down many safer avenues for sex work like Backpage and Craigslist personals, which
        allowed them to screen clients and share information. An increasingly stratified industry has revealed sex workers’ creative strategies as indicative of a marginalized and unprotected labor force in crisis. </p>

      <p>Although creators can achieve a windfall on OnlyFans, the work is inherently precarious. On August 19, OnlyFans announced it was banning “sexually explicit” content from its site in order to legitimize its operations in the eyes of investors
        and major banking institutions. Days later, following severe backlash, the company said it would “suspend” the policy changes. It did not, however, reserve them, leaving low-income earners in ongoing precarity. At any moment, OnlyFans or the
        banks could cut off sex workers again.</p>

      <p>We’ve all read the headlines about sex workers who make more than $100,000 per year on the platform, and how the average OnlyFans participant makes more than 270 times the average worker. But the reality is, according to a comprehensive
        study conducted by Influencer Marketing Hub, the average OnlyFans user makes $180/month, and most accounts take home less than $145/month. The top one percent of the accounts on OnlyFans make about 33 percent of all the money.</p>

      <p>Confined to media channels that haven’t censored them outright, it’s worth noting that the media that sex workers produce on sites like OnlyFans and elsewhere is meant for customers. Such media are not complete representations of sex
        workers; they do not convey life off the clock, nor are they intended to. This hasn’t stopped anti-sex work feminists and social reformers from using them as conditions of sexual labor. What these so-called glamorized depictions indirectly
        reveal about sex work in the post-SESTA/FOSTA era is the is the amount of unpaid labor that’s now required among sex workers, from curating a personal brand and attracting a fan base to expenditures for lighting and camera equipment. It used
        to be a sex worker could post an ad on a website like Backpage or Craigslist and make money. But now sex workers have to be influencers, too.</p>

      <p>People who sell sex are presented in media accounts only in stereotype: Most people have read NY Post headlines that feature either the happy empowered businesswoman-slash-sex worker or the tragic, down-on-her-luck prostitute. But for every
        sex worker who can work 40-plus hours a week and turn her hustle into a thriving career, there are 10 more who are struggling to make ends meet — students, part-time hustlers working around their disability or mental illness — and these are
        the people who are hurt the most when sex workers are deplatformed. </p>

      <hr>

      <p>Despite its reputation, there’s nothing very sexy about OnlyFans’ white-and-aqua interface. Unlike Persian Kitty, you won’t be greeted by images of scantily clad women striking seductive poses. You won’t receive suggestions to click on ads
        for “sexy student bodies” or “Game of Bones.” Instead, the OnlyFans algorithm will suggest you follow recording artists and chefs and fitness gurus. Even its users are not pornographers or sex workers, but rather the more antiseptically
        called “creators.” The only way to find adult content is to search for a specific user; unlike Pornhub, you cannot refine your search with filters or key words, rendering the search function on OnlyFans mostly useless unless you know who
        exactly you’re looking for. It’s practically impossible to gain subscribers through the site itself, and for creators without built-in social media followings, makes it difficult to achieve any kind of windfall. </p>

      <p>As Charlotte Shane notes in her New York Times Magazine feature about OnlyFans, “Newbies aren’t precluded from accruing a large base of followers or developing smaller groups of die-hard fans, and some manage it well. But attracting paying
        admirers for one’s self-created work doubles the amount of labor required to get paid anything at all.” </p>

      <p>Mary said she’s had some success gaining paying subscribers through search engine optimization — that is, inputting commonly searched-for terms to boost her OnlyFans profile via Google. Still, she says the additional unpaid labor hasn’t been
        worth it.</p>

      <p>“It’s a full-time job,” says Mary. “Customers want new content from you every day. You’re always posting new photos, new videos. Fans want one-on-one attention from you. It’s a daily grind."</p>

      <p>OnlyFans users pay to unlock direct messages, along with individual posts hidden behind pay walls. Fans tip to request “customs,” or personalized photos, videos, and audio recordings, from their favorite content creators. The latter is where
        Mary and other content creators say most of their money comes from. </p>

      <p>“I truly hate what online work has turned into, whether or not you’re working online, on OnlyFans, or just trying to advertise yourself online,” she said.</p>

      <p>Mary has had to adapt to a very different landscape for online sex work. Since making the shift to online, many sex workers have realized the time-to-money equation for sex work has shifted, as well. </p>

      <p>“I’ve attended so many webinars about transitioning to online work since last March, and they were almost all based on the often unspoken assumption that we can all devote at least 40 hours per week to our work — and that we have the space
        and privacy to do it.” Mary called online sex work the “funhouse mirror” of in-person sex work — the risks and benefits are nearly flipped in a wacky way. </p>

            }))
          }();
        </script>
      </p>
      <p>With in-person sex work, you have much higher risks of violence from both clients and the state because of physical proximity and criminalization, but they also have some extraordinary benefits: you have low start-up costs, can make a lot of
        money in a short period of time, get paid in cash right away so you can use the money immediately and don’t necessarily have to report it as income, can work inconsistently and for fewer hours, can be undocumented, and don’t have to worry too
        much about your privacy. </p>

      <p>The opposites are true for online work: you don’t experience physical or sexual violence or criminalization, but you need to invest time and money before you start to turn a profit, you will mostly get paid only every two weeks or once per
        month depending on the platform, the income will be reported to the government, you need an ID to do the work, you make a lot more money working consistently and for many hours per day, and you have to worry more about your privacy.</p>

      <p>The industry has become increasingly stratified. In order to earn a living wage, most new sex workers will now either work for management on the lower end of the hourly income spectrum, or they will need to put a lot of time and energy into
        building their own brand. </p>

      <p>Mary uses a lot of different platforms to advertise and on most of them she has to carefully curate and monitor her accounts in case they get suspended or shadow banned. Post-Backpage, sex workers trying to work online are constantly at the
        mercy of the algorithm and discriminatory content moderation practices, but not having access to those spaces to advertise and that low barrier to entry makes it much more work for people who are often trying to make money quickly.</p>

      <p>“I’m worried all the time about my accounts getting closed down,” Mary tells me. “I’m very cautious about what I can and can’t message in my DMs.”</p>

      <hr>

      <p>I’m >It used to be if you wanted to know what was really going on in your city you didn't read the Baltimore Sun, the San Francisco Chronicle, or the New York Times. You read Baltimore City Paper or the East Bay Express. And in New York you
        read the Village Voice, one of the first and best-known alt-weekly. The Voice was founded in 1955 by a group of writers and rabble rousers, including counterculture icon and wife-stabber, Norman Mailer. It came to be a valued source of
        muckraking independent journalism and wide-ranging cultural reporting recognized well beyond the city. </p>

      <p>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, alt-weeklies went through a period of consolidation. Bigger alt-weeklies were buying up publications in cities across the country. Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin, journalists who founded the alt-weekly Phoenix
        New Times in 1970 as college students and imbued it with a prankster libertarian free speech sensibility, were at the forefront of the consolidations. They acquired Denver Westword, the Dallas Observer and SF Weekly. It was the late 1990s and
        publishing was suddenly flush with cash. What could go wrong? The Internet, and with it, Craigslist.</p>

      <p>Craigslist was bad news for newspapers with classified listings, but it ended up being a turning point for sex workers and how they made money. </p>

      <p>Carl Ferrer, a classified ad salesman, proposed an in-house competitor to Craigslist, an online classifieds aggregator, so they made one and named it after the place in old weeklies where classifieds were placed — the back page. The idea
        proved hugely profitable: The site went from earning $26 million in 2010 to more than $134 million in 2014. By 2015, it had reportedly earned its owners more than $500 million. </p>

      <p>Alt-weeklies also carried ads for escorts and dominatrixes and other adult services. While these ads set many alt-weeklies apart from the more strait-laced legacy newspapers, it's unclear if the decision to carry such ads had much to do with
        sticking it to the man as it did the sex workers provided a reliable revenue stream. Craigslist and Backpage were both essentially online carbon copies of the alt-weekly classifieds that also had adult services sections. And for sex workers,
        this was a big deal because instead of having to solicit clients on the street, sex workers could post their own ads online. As a result, sex workers could screen clients online, posts were ephemeral and anonymous, making it easy to keep
        one's personal life and professional life separate. Sex workers could even connect with each other online, posting warnings about clients to avoid and finding each other and building support networks. </p>

      <p>But pivoting to digital also brought more surveillance and mobilized moral panic. Most people don't have strong opinions about what does and doesn't belong in a local print papers’ classified section. But nearly everyone has an opinion about
        what does and doesn't belong online, and plenty of people have opinions about sex work. Putting those two together created the legal and political maelstrom that led to the downfall of Craigslist personals and Backpage.</p>

      <p>On March 5, 2009, Tom Dart, the Sheriff of Cook County Illinois, filed a federal lawsuit against Craigslist, alleging the website was a “public nuisance” because it facilitated prostitution. He also sought $100,000 in reimbursement for
        investigator costs. At a press conference, Dart flipped back and forth between sex trafficking and sex work interchangeably before admitting his solution was to arrest all parties involved, including minors: “We're talking about charges we
        have for human trafficking, for juvenile rescue for juvenile pimping, for prostitution — we have all of it here. We have arrested 16-year-old girls, 15-year-old girls who have been posted on Craigslist,” he said. “And yet we have this, this
        website that facilitates this. And somehow we're all supposed to feel good about because it's a legitimate business. Since when have we felt good about a legitimate business that facilitates a criminal act is an accomplice? How's this any
        different than two individuals that enter into an agreement to conduct prostitution, where one will handle the women and the other one is going to advertise for them?”</p>

      <p>In fact, there was a big difference. That’s why a court judge tossed out Dart’s lawsuit seven months later. That difference hinged specifically on a federal law colloquially known as Section 230. It was first passed in 1996 as part of the
        Communications Decency Act, or CDA, which was supposed to protect children from online porn. Although the CDA was struck down and declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, Section 230 lived on as part of the Telecommunications Act. It
        stated that no provider of an internet service shall be held liable as like the publisher or speaker of stuff on the internet.</p>

      <p>In the case of Dart’s lawsuit, the court determined that Craigslist couldn't be sued over sex works ads because Craigslist wasn't personally writing the ads. Plus, having an erotic services section didn't by default mean that Craigslist was
        encouraging illegal activity. There are plenty of completely legal services that fit under that category, like a stripper hired for a bachelor party.</p>

      <p>Still, Craigslist made several changes in response to Dart’s lawsuit. They began charging for ads, required credit cards, and they renamed “erotic services” to “adult services.” They also boosted their content moderation efforts so that
        every adult post was reviewed by a human being. But none of these changes appeased their critics. And ultimately, on September 3, 2010, Craigslist shut down its adult section without warning and with little fanfare — just the word “censored”
        where the link for “adult services” used to be. Craigslist never formally issued a statement explaining their decision. Less than two weeks after the shutdown, Craigslist representatives testified at a House subcommittee hearing on domestic
        minor sex trafficking. They weren't just being accused of facilitating sex work ads. Now, they had to testify before Congress about their alleged role in aiding and abetting sex trafficking.</p>

      <p>The ads sex workers had once found an audience for on Craigslist now migrated to other sites. And the groups opposed to sex work ads followed sex workers to those sites, too.</p>

      <p>Tension mounted in January 2017 when the investigations arm of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs published a report after a nearly two-year-long investigation into Backpage. It argued that the site knowingly
        enabled crimes through its automated filtering of specific terms. By now letting users publish posts with phrases like “barely legal,” the report argued, Backpage was, in fact, coaching child traffickers to better cover their tracks. Backpage
        got rid of its adult section within days of the report dropping although sex work ads continued to appear discreetly in the personal section. Larkin and Lacey didn’t help their cause when they insisted on pleading the fifth for the entirety
        of their Senate testimony a few days later. </p>

      <p>In April, Missouri representative Ann Wagner introduced the “Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act,” also known as FOSTA. A few months later, the Senate introduced their own version of FOSTA called the “Stop Enabling
        Sex Trafficking Act,” or SESTA. Both bills proposed carving out an exception in Section 230 for sex trafficking and promoting prostitution. Supporters said denying websites like Backpage these protections would make it possible to prosecute
        them. SESTA/FOSTA are generally talked about together as a single bill that was ostensibly written to prosecute Backpage. But its chilling effects on other websites, and its impact on sex workers, was obvious before it was even signed into
        law. Within hours of the bill passing the Senate in March 2018, Reddit banned several sex work-oriented subreddit communities. Within days, Craigslist removed its entire personal section. And after then-President Trump signed it into law,
        House representatives celebrated those shutdowns as the direct result of the new law.</p>

      <p>SESTA/FOSTA has yet to accomplish its alleged purpose of fighting sex trafficking and providing a path to justice for victims. But in terms of fighting online sex work, which most of the law’s supporters said was necessary to fight sex
        trafficking, SESTA/FOSTA was a tremendous success.</p>

      <p>Sex workers reported that clients preyed on their precarity in just a few weeks after the law passed when rent was due, with abusive clients trying to negotiate on sex workers’ rates, knowing that sex workers’ options had been drastically
